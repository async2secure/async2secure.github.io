## Dual Hiding + Masking

Async2Secure has employed the novel Dual-Hiding + Masking circuit design technique
developed by Prof. Bah Hwee Gwee and his PhD student, Dr. Kwen Siong Chong.
This technique provides highly secured Vertical and Horizontal Hiding, as well as algorithm-
based Masking simultaneously to countermeasure against Side Channel Attacks.
The details of Dual-Hiding + Masking technology are as follows:

1. Asynchronous SAHB balanced logic
2. Delay Control + Jittering
3. Key Masking
