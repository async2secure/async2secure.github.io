## Filter Bank
Digital Hearing Aid Center has designed our products by employing the novel 16 channel
critical band spaced digital filter bank design [1] with natural hearing response proposed by
Prof Bah Hwee Gwee and Prof Joseph Sylvester Chang from School of Electrical & Electronic
Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. Prof Gwee and Prof Chang are
the digital hearing instrument experts which has invented many useful low-distortion
(<THD+N: - 78dB) digital filter bank, low power (~60μW@1.1V) Class-D amplifier [2] and digital
signal processor [3] circuits for practical digital hearing instrument. They currently own 3 US
granted patents on circuit design. They have been the IEEE Distinguished Lecturers for IEEE
Circuits and Systems Society.
