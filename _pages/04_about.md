## About Us

We are a research team specializing in the integrated circuits (IC) design and hardware security. Previously, we focused on designing, implementing, prototyping and measuring numerous IC chips to demonstrate the novelties of our design techniques for achieving targeted area/power/speed specifications in DSP, space, biomedical applications.

Currently, we move forward to leverage our IC design skills to improve the security features of the IC chips against a few attacks, e.g. reverse engineering, side channel attack, fault injection attack, yet minimizing the area/power/speed overheads. The main targeted applications are IP protection, cryptography and hardware reliability.
