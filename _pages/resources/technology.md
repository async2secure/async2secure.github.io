<strong>Async2Secure</strong> has employed the novel US patented <strong>Asynchronous-Logic</strong> Quasi-Delay-
Insensitive Sense-Amplifier Half-Buffer (SAHB) circuit design technique invented by our co-
founders, i.e. <strong>Bah-Hwee Gwee</strong> and <strong>Kwen-Siong Chong</strong>. This technique provides highly
secured Vertical and Horizontal Hiding simultaneously to countermeasure against <strong>Side
Channel Attacks</strong>. Over the years, we have successfully prototyped and measured some IC
chips. Their measurement results have been published in well-recognized IC design journals
and conferences. (Kindly click the links below to the corresponding publication)

<strong>Async2Secure</strong> has employed the novel <strong>Dual-Hiding + Masking</strong> circuit design technique
developed by our co-founders, i.e. <strong>Bah-Hwee Gwee</strong> and <strong>Kwen-Siong Chong</strong> for high secure
cryptographic devices. This technique collectively combine the highly secured Vertical Hiding
and Horizontal Hiding, as well as algorithm-based Masking simultaneously to countermeasure
against <strong>Side Channel Attacks</strong>.

<strong>Async2Secure</strong> has employed the novel Singapore patented <strong>Camouflage Digital Cells</strong> circuit
design technique invented by our co-founders, i.e. <strong>Bah-Hwee Gwee</strong> and <strong>Kwen-Siong
Chong</strong>. This technique provides highly secured protection to the IC design intellectual
property to countermeasure against <strong>Reverse Engineering</strong>.
