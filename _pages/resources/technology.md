### (1) Asynchronous-Logic

<strong>Async2Secure</strong> in part employs <strong>Asynchronous-Logic</strong> as a technology means to enhance the
Hardware Security of ASICs/FPGAs. The basic mechanism of asynchronous-logic is to have a
data synchronization based on localized handshaking protocols as opposed to that based on
global clock infrastructure. Figure below depicts the asynchronous data propagation (D1 to
D2 to D3) through the Dual-rail logic circuit and latches (L1 and L2) using the handshake
signals (HS) generated by completion detection (CD).

Most of asynchronous-logic research works adopted by Async2Secure were largely conducted
in Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. Some microphotographs of the
asynchronous-logic prototype microchips are depicted as below. For more information, please

### (2) Side-Channel Attack (SCA) Countermeasures on Dual-Hiding (+Masking)

<strong>Async2Secure</strong> adopts <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8457238">Dual-Hiding + Masking</a>  approaches to achieve high SCA-resistance and
yet low power/area overheads for cipher designs (including Advanced Encryption Standard
(AES)). The primary enabler is in part to use asynchronous-logic to ‘hide’ or moderate the
amplitude and timing information on the power or electromagnetic profiles. The conventional
Masking approach is also included to add additional protection to counteract SCA.
Async2Secure makes the operation of the asynchronous-logic handshaking to achieve the
possible ‘best’ dual-hiding optimization.

### (3) Camouflage IC

<strong>Async2Secure</strong> employs patent-pending <strong>Camouflage Digital Cells</strong> circuit design technique. The
basic idea is to make at least two or more digital cells having a look-alike layout view but with
different functions. These camouflage digital cells are also intelligently inserted in a netlist in
strategic locations where the outputs of these camouflage digital cells have a high output
corruptibility rate. Asynchronous-logic implantation can be even used to make the full/partial
brute-force netlist analysis impossible. Collectively, the camouflage digital cells with their
associated netlist placement and asynchronous-logic implementation provide highly secured
protection to the IC design intellectual property to countermeasure against <strong>Reverse
Engineering</strong>.
