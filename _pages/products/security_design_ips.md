## Security Design IPs
(1) SCA-Resistant AES (FPGA or ASIC)

SCA-Resistant AES design with dual-hiding and asynchronous-logic countermeasures
provides basic SCA protection for data encryption

(2) SCA-Resistant Masked AES (FPGA or ASIC)

SCA-Resistant Masked AES design with dual-hiding, asynchronous-logic and additional
masking countermeasures provides added SCA protection for data encryption

(3) ASIC Camouflage Library Cells

ASIC Camouflage Library Cells with look-alike cell layout provide high resistance to reverse
engineering for IP protection
