Singapore, in 2001, 2002, and 2007 respectively.
He is presently a Senior Research Scientist with Temasek Laboratories @ NTU, Singapore. He
was a visiting researcher in Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Japan, in 2010, and in
the University of Michigan, USA, in 2012. He is/was principal investigator (PI), co-PI, and
collaborator of several research projects, including the projects supported from National
Science Foundation (Singapore), Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (USA),
Ministry of Education (Singapore), and Public Sector Research Funding (Singapore). He co-
founded a start-up company in 2019. His research interests include hardware security, space-
grade resilient circuits and systems, asynchronous VLSI designs, low-voltage low power VLSI
circuits, and audio signal processing.
Dr. Chong was the Chair of IEEE Circuits and Systems (CAS) Society, Singapore Chapter, in
2017 and 2018. He has served as an organizing committee for several conferences, including
the ASP-DAC 2014, DSP-2015, DSP-2018 and SOCC2019. He has been a member of IEEE CAS
Society VLSI Systems and Applications Technical Committee since 2009. He is an IEEE senior
member.
