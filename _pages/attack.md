## Hardware Attacks
The demands for hardware encryption market is huge, i.e. $252B at 2020 for various security
applications such as defence, finance, data management, wireless communication, internet of
things etc.

However, the encryption devices are highly vulnerable to the attackers/hackers in order to
steal the secret keys, stored information, design intellectual properties (IPs) etc.

The common hardware attacks, are ranging from
* side-channel attacks,
* semi-invasive attacks to
* reverse engineering,

on Integrated Circuits and Field Programmable Gate Arrays.

By using the side-channel attacks, the attackers could study the profiles of power dissipation
and electromagnetic emission (EM), form the correlation with the power/EM models, and
hence reveal the secret key used for AES data encryption.

By using the reverse engineering, the attackers could delayer the chip microphotograph,
analyse the layout and netlist of the circuits, and hence reveal the design information, i.e.
design IPs.
